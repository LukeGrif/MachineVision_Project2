# üöó Machine Vision Assignment: Speed Sign Detector

## üìò Overview

This project presents a complete speed sign detection and recognition pipeline using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system:

- Detects speed signs using HSV color filtering  
- Refines candidate regions using morphological operations  
- Classifies the detected regions using a 1-Nearest Neighbour (1-NN) classifier  

It outputs both **visual bounding boxes** and **terminal logs** of detected signs.

## üß† Background

Modern driver assistance systems rely on real-time speed sign detection. This project explores traditional computer vision and lightweight ML methods to implement such a system.

Key concepts used include:

- **HSV color space segmentation**  
- **Morphological image processing**  
- **1-NN classification using exemplar matching**  
- **Edge handling and fallback calibration for poor lighting**

> üìñ Includes discussion of RGB-HSV conversion, edge detection, and shape analysis.

## üß± Architecture Overview

The project is divided into three Python modules:

### 1. `roidmds.py` ‚Äì Region Proposer
- Converts RGB to HSV
- Applies hue, saturation, and value masks
- Refines results with morphological opening/closing
- Adds erosion/dilation for robustness to lighting conditions

---

### 2. `classifier.py` ‚Äì 1-Nearest Neighbour Classifier
- Loads precomputed exemplar descriptors
- Preprocesses regions (grayscale, resize, normalize)
- Uses Euclidean distance to classify speed sign
- 
---

### 3. `SignSelector.py` ‚Äì System Orchestrator
- Handles full detection pipeline
- Displays bounding boxes and labels on images
- Logs results to terminal

---

## üîß Testing & Calibration

Automated testing was implemented with:
- Image naming conventions used to parse expected results
- HSV and morphological thresholds tuned through trial
- Erosion masks added to minimize false positives
- Fallback logic added to catch signs in dark scenes

**Threshold Summary Table:**

| Parameter     | Value  |
|---------------|--------|
| Hue Min       | 0.949  |
| Hue Max       | 0.048  |
| Saturation    | 0.265  |
| Value         | 0.11   |

## üìä Results

Tested on images including faded, skewed, or dimly lit signs. The algorithm accurately:
- Proposes valid regions
- Eliminates false positives
- Classifies signs such as 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 120 km/h

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project successfully developed a robust pipeline for speed sign detection using classic computer vision tools combined with basic machine learning:

- HSV thresholding isolates sign colors  
- Morphological operations reduce noise  
- 1-NN classification accurately identifies speed values  

The system is resilient to lighting variance, occlusion, and multiple sign types, making it well-suited for real-world extension.
